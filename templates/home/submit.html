        <p>Hi there! Welcome to Aksar Kounseling! We appreciate your preferences. Here's a guide to help you
            understand the therapy process. <br />
            The therapy process involves finding a qualified and licensed counselor who matches your needs. We
            will carefully review the information you've shared and connect you with a personalized counselor. Your
            counselor will reach out to you, and you can start your therapy sessions online. <br />
            Your counselor will be a professional with experience in anger management and narcissism treatment.
            They will provide personalized guidance and support throughout your therapy journey. <br />
            You can communicate with your counselor in various ways. You can send audio, video, or text messages
            in the messaging room at any time. Additionally, you can schedule weekly live sessions lasting 30 to 45
            minutes via phone, video, or live chat. <br />
            If you feel that the counselor you have been matched with isn't the right fit for you, you can request to
            be matched with a different counselor. We have a vast network of over 10,000 counselors with diverse
            qualifications and areas of expertise. We will strive to find a counselor who better meets your needs.
            <br />
            We hope this simplified explanation helps you understand our counseling services better. <br />
        </p> <br/>
